Machine Learning Playground

`mlpg` stands for `Machine Learning Playground`

It is a hands-on repository for self-learning of machine learning algorithms by solving real problems using pytorch and other ML libraries.

## ML Problems

### MNIST

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from [this page](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

You can see the Pytorch model in the [mnist.py](./mlpg/models/mnist.py) module, with an example of usage in the [MNIST notebook](./notebooks/mnist.ipynb).


## Running the tests

```bash
python -m pytest
```
